Sorry I'm too lazy to write this.

I'll update this when I have time.


Building the PlurkVala Library
------------------------------

You can build the library either manually or using the build system included.

To build the library manually, make sure you are located in the PlurkVala 
project directory and follow these steps:

1) Generate the *.c, *.h, and *.vapi files.

$ valac --pkg libsoup-2.4 --pkg json-glib-1.0 ./*.vala -C -H ./plurk.h --library plurk

2) Compile and build the .so file.

$ gcc -o ./libplurk.so --shared -fPIC ./*.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs libsoup-2.4` `pkg-config --cflags --libs json-glib-1.0`

You should now have a working shared library file in this directory.  


Using the Library in plurker
----------------------------

You could use the included build system to install the PlurkVala library.  But 
if you don't yet feel comfortable installing an experimental library, you can 
dynamically load the library locally.

Assuming that you're now in the plurker project directory, and that the 
PlurkVala directory is at the same level and is a sibling directory, follow 
the following steps:

1) Generate the binary for plurker

$ valac -X -I../PlurkVala/ -X -L../PlurkVala/ -X -lplurk -o ./plurker ./plurker.vala ../PlurkVala/plurk.vapi --basedir ./ --pkg libsoup-2.4 --pkg json-glib-1.0 --pkg posix

2) Run the binary

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../PlurkVala/ ./plurker
